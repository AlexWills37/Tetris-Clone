# Tetris Clone
This game "Quadtris" is a clone of the popular game Tetris made in Python using John Zelle's graphics.py package. This game was created as part of an assignment for my Intermediate Python class

### How to play
To play this game, follow these steps:
1. Download the project files
2. Make sure all files are in the same folder
3. Run 'game.py' from the folder

### Development
I made this game over the course of a few weeks.
- Learn how to use graphics.py
- Create animations
- Learn user interaction
- Determine how to store information about what blocks are where
- Figure out how to move and rotate pieces
- Create game logic
- Tweak speed and timing for a better user experience

### Future Steps
- Improve rotation system to use math to generalize rotation, instead of the current hardcoded solution
- Improve the graphics
- Rethink the system to take advantage of Object Oriented Design
